simple_feature_selection

We provide code in base R which uses the lm() function to perform multiple linear regression
The model is stored in a variable, which allows use of some parsing to extract only the
model factors with significance according to a threshold set in the code
This method allows generating a model with better predictive performance on new data all programmatically

See the PDF for a full writeup of the method
